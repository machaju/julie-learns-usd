Okay, "learns" is a bit of a stretch.. Project to familiarize myself with USD 


## Simple Object Rotations 
[scripts/simple-rotating-obj](/scripts/simple-rotating-obj) contains a python files that creates a USDGeom object based off of user input and adds some rotation. 

## House Shading and Rotation
[scripts/house/](/scripts/house/) contains two python files, one for rotation and the other for shading. 

### Rotation
[scripts/house/rotating-house.py](/scripts/house/rotating-house.py) uses referencing to create a Stage with a refernce to a premade House mesh and then adds rotation to the house so that it spins. 

### Shading 
[scripts/house/shade-house.py](/scripts/house/shade-house.py) uses a premade [diffuse image](/scripts/house/house_diffuse.jpg) to shade the house.
